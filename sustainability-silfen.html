          At SILFEN sustainability means putting action behind the words,
          considering all stakeholders and always aiming a little bit higher
          when creating another collection.

          Since day one, we have launched various initiatives to keep our carbon
          footprint to an absolute minimum as well as making conscious decisions
          concerning the social impact on the communities in the countries, in
          which we operate.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a company with great manufacturing activities, we know that we have
          a responsibility. Our focus is to make as green a production as
          possible, and we will continue to launch new initiatives to lower our
          carbon footprint even further.

              All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is either made from
              eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less
              consumption of water throughout production and treatment of our
              cotton, than conventional cotton products.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries
              worldwide, and one of the biggest issues is the use and
              contamination of drinking water. We try to minimize the water
              consumption in our production in an effort to decrease its
              negative impact on the environment and to ensure local access to
              clean water.

        <p>
          We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or
          train. These are the most environmentally friendly modes of shipping,
          reducing polluting emissions
        </p>
        <p>
          We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on
          our planet. Because of this, we strive to choose
          environmental-friendly shipping options when applicable. We are in
          close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as
          much as possible – by joining forces.
